## 🤯 Overview: What is ECHO?

Welcome to **ECHO**! This is a tense 2D survival/puzzle game developed by a small group of highly motivated (and slightly sleep-deprived) secondary school students. 😴

In **ECHO**, light is scarce, but sound is your superpower! You play as a character trapped in a dark environment and must use your unique ability—**Echolocation**—to momentarily reveal the hidden monsters and valuable loot around you.

We poured our blood, sweat, and tears (mostly stress tears from midterms) into this project, focusing on core mechanics like the togglable **Sound Mode**, a functional **Inventory System**, and **real-time looting**.

## 🎮 Core Features 

ECHO is built around a few core, headache-inducing (in a good way!) features:

| Icon | Feature | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 🔊 | **Sound Mode Toggle** | Press **'E'** to enter Sound Mode! The screen instantly flips to grayscale, and your vision is replaced by sound waves that pulse automatically to reveal nearby objects. |
| 👻 | **Object Revelation** | Monsters and loot boxes are invisible in Normal Mode! When the sound wave hits them, they briefly glow with a vibrant high-contrast effect, giving you a chance to react! |
| 🎒 | **Inventory System** | A full 20-slot inventory grid! Items don't stack—every unique loot piece takes its own slot, forcing strategic resource management. |
| 🗃️ | **Drag-and-Drop** | Fully functional drag-and-drop support for swapping items between inventory slots. Time to organize that backpack! |
| ☠️ | **Loot & Death Penalty** | Collect randomized loot by searching containers! But be warned: if you die, your inventory is **completely wiped** (a truly painful post-midterm feeling). |
